# Using Crystal
Crystal comes in two parts. The Heart (or main server), and the Shard (or client). The Heart requires a Window's machine for now, and network access. The Shard can be run on any machine and needs network access as well.

After you have downloaded the seperate parts as zip files, extract the folders into their respective locations (it does not matter where). Inside of each directory there is a bin folder. To run the respective software, run either the .bat file or the shell file, depending on what OS you are using. Crystal does NOT require administrator permissions.

From there the software will walk you through the quick setup steps, and you are ready to go!

# Building Crystal
Crystal is built with a Gradle wrapper. After cloning or downloading the repository, navigate to the root folder and open your command line. Execute `gradlew build`. The build automatically copies the compiled zip files into the .distributions folder in the root directory. To run, simply unzip the folder(s) and execute the jar files.
