Here's how the heart handles connections through socket:

Hosts on it's own IP (maybe change this, i'm not really sure yet)

Hosts on port 6976

accepts an incoming connection on the port

if(heart config is set up):
sends (the first) Registration packet to client containing server GUID for authentication and the command key (ie "ok crystal")
else:
Declines and closes connection with an error packet (info in the packetString)

waits for registration packet from shard that contains shard GUID. This allows the heart to identify per shard, with details such
	as location, name, type, etc (heart will not accept other data without this packet).

if:
heart recognizes the shard as a device that's been set up before, sends Handshake packet and it will be open to packet types (below)
else:
tell the shard that it needs to have the config set up, and then to reconnect with a closeconnection packet type.

Available commands for shard from here:
Close Connection (no info required)
Command (requires packetString containing the command)

Heart closes the connection with a CloseConnection packet containing reason in packetString
